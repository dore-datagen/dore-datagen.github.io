# Conclusion

Over the course of this tutorial, we have learnt quite a few things:

1. The E-Commerce schema
2. How to use Dore to generate fake data for the ecommerce schema.
3. The **Dore Manifest**.
4. What are **Datastores**, **Models**, and **Attributes** and how to define them in a Manifest for any schema.
5. How to add **Value Definitions** for attributes in the Manifest which define how Dore will generate values for them.
6. How to **invoke Dore** with a Manifest.
7. How to use **variables in the Manifest** and provide values for the variables while invoking Dore.
8. How to handle **model conflicts**.
9. How to **split the manifest into multiple files** to keep the datastore and model definitions readable and 
   maintainable.

Although this tutorial was specific to creating a single MySQL database with a few tables, Dore can work with 
many kinds of systems and schemas. So, what are you waiting for? Start creating manifests for schemas for your own 
services and share it with fellow members!

On and ending note, thank you for going through this tutorial. We hope it has helped in making working with Dore a bit 
easier.
