# Creating the Manifest

Let's go ahead and create a new file called `dore-ecommerce-manifest.json` and open it up in our favorite editor.

### Manifest `id`

Each manifest needs to have an ID. So let's add that to the Manifest:

```json linenums="1" title="dore-ecommerce-manifest.json" hl_lines="2"
{
  "id": "ecommerce-example"
}
```

Each manifest should specify an `id` string to identify the manifest. Although Dore doesn't use this ID, it has been
kept as a required field as it helps in improving the readability of the manifest.
